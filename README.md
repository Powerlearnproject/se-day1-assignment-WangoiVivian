Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is systematically applying engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high qualitysoftware systems.
Its impotance include; enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of moder life like communication, commerse,entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include;
The development of programming languages like Fortran, C.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements; Its the gathering and documenting user needs and systm requirements.
Design; It invoves the creation of high-level and detailed design of the softaware architecture and user interface.
Impplementation; Writing the code and building the software according to the design sspecifications.
Testing; Conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment; Releaing software to users or customers.
Maintenance; Providing ongoing support, upates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies is the sequential approach with distinct phase eg requirement, design, implementation following downwards like a waterfall while agile methodologies is the iterative and incremenyal approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team
Software Developer; Is reposnsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer; Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager; Oversees the planning, execution  and delivery of software projects. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); It provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes eg Visual studio.
Version Control Systems (VCS); Its used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges; Changin requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt.
Strategies to overcome challenges; Effective communication, Agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, egular reassesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing; Testing individual components or modules of software.
Itegration testing; Testibg interactions between different components or subsystems.
Systen testing; Testing the entire softwarea as a whole.
Acceptance testing; Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Their importance; Helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to high-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance; Promp engineerring helps avoid vague question and getting a confusing answer by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
Vague; Cats don't like snakes
Improved; Explain why cats don't like sankes?. This prompt is effective because it will make AI gve clear answer.
